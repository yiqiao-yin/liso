# liso Package in R

## Background

In statistics, the backfitting algorithm is a simple iterative procedure used to fit a generalized additive model. It was introduced in 1985 by Leo Breiman and Jerome Friedman along with generalized additive models. In most cases, the backfitting algorithm is equivalent to the Gaussâ€“Seidel method algorithm for solving a certain linear system of equations.
